# Mobile App Boilerplate

This is an Mobile App project made with Ionic, Capacitor and Typescript. It can be build to an iOS or Android app.
The idea is to use this repo as a boilerplate, since it already has:

**Pages and Components:**
- Login page
- Bottom Bar Menu with 4 pages as example.
- Toast components (to show warning, success and error messages).
- Form and Labeled Textfields.
- Buttons.
- Icons file.
- Page Heading.
- Some Fonts components (like H1, H2, P, Small, etc).

**Logic:**
- Connection to Backend.
- Authentication.
- Persistent session even if the app is closed.
- Session Provider (to access session data throughout the app).
- Toast Provider (to access session data throughout the app).
